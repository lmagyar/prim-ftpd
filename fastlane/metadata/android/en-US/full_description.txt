A simple FTP and SFTP (SSH file transfer) server. Allows to exchange files with
other machines over WiFi. No more USB cable searching. Runs without root
privileges and is not started when device boots: Control yourself when the
server runs. However, while it runs it prevents standby to avoid long uploads
and downloads to abort.
